        <h2>Celeste</h2>
        <p>It stars the player character Madeline, a young woman with anxiety and depression who endeavors to climb Celeste Mountain. During her climb, she encounters several characters, including a personification of her self-doubt, which the community has named Badeline, who attempts to stop her from reaching the mountain's summit.</p>

                <p>Celeste is a two-dimensional platform game. The player controls Madeline, who has the ability to run, jump, climb walls for a limited time, wall jump, and dash in mid-air in one of eight directions. Certain objects grant Madeline additional abilities. Green gems refill her dash ability without the need to land on the ground. Other objects include "dream blocks" that transport her from one side to another when dashed into, moving blocks that can transfer their momentum to Madeline when jumped off of, bubbles that move her when touched, and platforms that move after she dashes. The difficulty can be lowered through the use of an "Assist Mode", a setting that provides accessibility options including a lowered game speed, unlimited use of the dash ability, or the option to grant Madeline invincibility.</p>
