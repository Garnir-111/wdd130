        <h2>Cuphead</h2>
        <p>Cuphead is a run and gun indie video game developed and published by Studio MDHR. The game was inspired by 1930s cartoons, and features hand-drawn animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.</p>

                    <p>Cuphead's gameplay is centered on continual boss fights, interspersed with run-and-gun levels. Each is housed in one of four worlds, with the final fight against the Devil. Each boss fight includes a simple, regular, and expert difficulty mode (with the exception of the final two bosses, which lack a simple mode). Defeating a boss on regular mode is required to progress through the game and unlocks expert mode for that particular level. Most boss battles take place on land, although some involve player characters piloting aeroplanes and play like a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The game includes role-playing elements and a branching level sequence.[2][3] Player characters have infinite lives, maintaining all equipment between deaths.</p>
