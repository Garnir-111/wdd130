        <h2>Hades</h2>
        <p>Hades is a roguelike dungeon crawler video game developed and published by Supergiant Games. The player controls Zagreus, the son of Hades, as he attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, aided by various Olympian gods.</p>

                    <p>The game is presented in an isometric view, with the player controlling Zagreus. The player starts a run by fighting through several rooms drawn from a pool of pre-determined layouts, with the order they appear in and the enemies that appear being randomized. The game features a hack and slash combat system.[2] The player has a primary attack and a secondary "special" attack depending on their pre-determined weapon of choice, a magic "cast" that can be used from a distance, a dash that provides momentary intangibility and mobility, allows the player to phase through thin enough walls and gaps, and can deal damage when combined with an attack or Boon, and a summon attack that can call upon the power of one of the Gods. Throughout a run, the Olympians will provide Boons, each of which provides a choice of three persistent boosts and effects for that run that the player can select from. The Boons are themed based on the Olympian; for example, Zeus's Boons provide lightning damage effects and Poseidon's provide push-back wave effects.</p>
